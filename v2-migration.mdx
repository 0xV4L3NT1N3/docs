# V2 Migration

As of August 15th 2025, we've deprecated the legacy V1 endpoints in favor or the new Etherscan API V2, our latest multichain update.&#x20;

To reiterate, all methods including balances, source code, remain accessible (and better if you're querying multiple chains :rainbow:) once you use the new V2 format.

A legacy V1 endpoint that needs to be migrated looks like these

```
https://api.etherscan.io/api
https://api.basescan.org/api
https://api.polygonscan.com/api
https://api.bscscan.com/api
https://api.apescan.io/api
```

You'd also know if you get a deprecation error message

```json
{
   "status":"0",
   "message":"NOTOK",
   "result":"You are using a deprecated V1 endpoint, switch to Etherscan API V2."
}
```

A word about tooling that uses the APIs, such as Hardhat/Foundry/Remix have all migrated. If you're seeing this error, make sure to use an Etherscan API Key.

## 1. Create an Etherscan account

[**Sign up**](https://etherscan.io/register) if you don't have an account of if you were using other explorers like BaseScan/BscScan/Polygonscan etc.&#x20;

## 2. Create an Etherscan API Key

Under your Etherscan [**API dashboard**](https://etherscan.io/apidashboard), create a new key

## 3. Using Your Existing Calls

All V1 endpoints are backwards compatible, so if you had&#x20;

```
https://api.etherscan.io/api?&action=balance&apikey=YourEtherscanApiKeyToken
```

You only need to add the `/v2` and a `chainid`

```
https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=1&action=balance&apikey=YourEtherscanApiKeyToken
```

## 4. Using Your Existing Calls From Other Explorers

All V1 endpoints from other explorers such as Basescan/BscScan/Polygonscan etc are backwards compatible, so if you had

```
https://api.polygonscan.com/api?&action=balance&apikey=YourPolygoncsanApiKeyToken
```

You only need to use an Etherscan `/v2` path, include a `chainid` and use your Etherscan API Key.

```
https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=1&action=balance&apikey=YourEtherscanApiKeyToken
```
