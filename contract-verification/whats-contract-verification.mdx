> Contract verification is essentially **open-sourcing** your contract code.

Contract verification allows smart contract developers to prove and publish the **source code** of the contracts deployed on-chain.

You may have come across some of them when browsing the [**Contract tab**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x388c818ca8b9251b393131c08a736a67ccb19297#code) of any contract address on Etherscan.

## How do I verify a contract I've deployed ?

If you've deployed your contract using an online tool such as Remix, or OpenZeppelin's Contract Wizard, consider using the [**contract verification**](https://etherscan.io/verifyContract) page.

If you've deployed your contract using a development tool such as Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle and so on, consider using [**plugins**](plugins.md) to automate the verification process.
