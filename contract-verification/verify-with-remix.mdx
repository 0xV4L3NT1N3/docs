description: "Use the Remix Contract Verification plugin to verify contracts on Etherscan."

[**Remix**](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a no-frills, just works in your browser Solidity development tool.

## Activate

Once you've written and deployed your contract, click on the **Plugin Manager** and select **Contract Verification**.

## Add an API Key

The Etherscan verification plugin requires an [**API key**](../getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics.md)**,** because grumpy bots yell at us on a daily basis.

Click the "Enable" link and add your key, leave the rest as default.

## Verify

Fill in the chain, contract address, and contract name that you deployed.

Now that the Etherscan checkbox is enabled, click Verify. Without this, the contract won't show as verified on Etherscan's explorer.

Once verified, you will see a happy green.
