<Info>
You must update to  the nightly build of Foundry to use this at the moment, via `foundryup --install nightly`
</Info>

[**Foundry**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) is a tool that helps take the heat off smart contract development steps, including compiling, deploying and finally submitting your contract for verification.

## Deploy and Verify

```bash
forge create --broadcast --rpc-url https://rpc.sepolia.ethpandaops.io --private-key YourPrivateKey src/ContractFile.sol:ContractName --verify --verifier etherscan --etherscan-api-key YourApiKeyToken
```

## Verify an Existing Contract

```bash
forge verify-contract --watch --chain sepolia 0x324eca20b358b18e48f2611f7452560ce3b3c1bb src/ContractFile.sol:ContractName --verifier etherscan --etherscan-api-key YourApiKeyToken
```

## Migrating from V1

<Warning>
API keys from any other explorer (such as BscScan/Basescan/Arbiscan) have been deprecated
</Warning>

The easiest way to migrate is to simply pass in your [**Etherscan**](https://etherscan.io/) key via `--etherscan-api-key`&#x20;

For deployment scripts, in `foundry.toml` you can shorten your settings to this, without needing a different key for each chain.

```toml
etherscan_api_key = "VZFDUWB3YGQ1YCDKTCU1D6DDSS6EWI62KV"

[etherscan]
mainnet   = { key = "${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY}" } 
```
