Etherscan is the leading blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for Ethereum and EVM compatible chains.

{/* A lot of the features we’ve built definitely includes accurate on chain data, but also other details that helped us navigate what it means. We built an explorer that helped ourselves understand who owns this address, what did this trnsaction do, what are my token balances.

The APIs provide access to this information as you would use Etherscan, allowing you to build apps and dapps (that rhymes!) that help users make sense of "blockchain".  */}

With [API V2](/v2-migration), we've unified all 50+ [supported chains](/supported-chains) to share the same account and API keys. Your app goes multichain 🌈 just by changing the `chainid` to support BNB Smart Chain(BSC), Base, Arbitrum, HyperEVM et al.
