Etherscan is the leading blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for Ethereum, a decentralized smart contracts platform.

As a means to provide equitable access to blockchain data, we've developed the Etherscan Developer APIs to empower developers with direct access to Etherscan's block explorer data and services via GET/POST requests.

Etherscan's APIs are provided as a community service and without warranty, so please use what you need and no more.
