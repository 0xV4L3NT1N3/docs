## Common Error Messages

<Info>
An API call that encounters an error will return 0 as its `status code` and display the cause of the error under the `result` field.
</Info>

```json
{
  "status": "0",
  "message": "NOTOK",
  "result": "Max rate limit reached, please use API Key for higher rate limit"
}
```

### Missing or Unsupported Chain

<Warning>
"Missing or unsupported chainid parameter (required for v2 api), please see chainlist for the list of supported chainids"
</Warning>

The chain you've specified is not supported by us yet. It could also be that you've sent multiple chains at the same time like `420,10`, you can only send **one** at a time.

### Invalid API Key

<Warning>
"Invalid API Key"
</Warning>

This error occurs when you specify an invalid API Key.

Ensure you are using your **Etherscan API Key**, keys from other chains like Polygonscan/Arbiscan are not valid for V2.

Keys do take a few minutes to activate, anything longer than should be alarming.

### Max rate limit

<Warning>
"Max rate limit reached, please use API Key for higher rate limit"
</Warning>

This error occurs when you **exceed the rate limit** assigned to your specific API key.

To resolve, adhere to the [**rate limits**](https://etherscan.io/apis#rate-limits) of your available plan.

If you are using a script or application, **apply throttling** like a token bucket to limit the frequency of calls.

### Missing or invalid action

<Warning>
"Error! Missing Or invalid Action name"
</Warning>

This error occurs when you **do not specify**, or specify an **invalid** `module` and `action` name.

To resolve, **double check** your API query to use a valid module and action name.

If you require some help getting started, try copying the sample queries provided in the [**API Endpoints**](https://github.com/BlockSolutions/etherscan-api-docs/blob/master/support/broken-reference/README.md) and pasting them into your browser.

### Endpoint-specific errors

<Warning>
"Error! Block number already pass"

"Error! Invalid address format"

"Contract source code not verified"
</Warning>

These error messages returned are specific to certain endpoints and their **related parameters.**

To resolve, kindly refer to the specific endpoint's documentation, and check for the **correct format** or **values** to be specified as **parameters.**

### Query Timeout

<Warning>
"Query Timeout occured. Please select a smaller result dataset"

"Unexpected err, timeout occurred or server too busy. Please try again later"
</Warning>

This error occurs when you have sent a particularly large query that did not manage to be completed in time.

To resolve, consider selecting a smaller date/block range, though you may [**ping us**](./getting-help.mdx) if you think the issue may be performance related.

### Migrate from V1

<Warning>
"Max calls per sec rate limit reached (2/sec). Please switch to API V2"
</Warning>

Please migrate to using Etherscan V2, with your Etherscan API key, here's our [**migration guide**](../v2-migration.mdx).

Legacy V1 endpoints from other explorers are accessible by passing in the chain ID, eg 8453 for Base.

### Free Tier Throttled

<Warning>
"Free API access is temporarily unavailable due to unusually high network activity"
</Warning>

During periods of very high load, Free tier requests may be throttled. For uninterrupted access, using any [**Paid tier**](https://etherscan.io/apis) will have your requests prioritized.
